<h2 id="about">About<a href="#about"></a></h2>
<p>
<a href="#emacs-keys">Emacs Keys</a> was created by <a
href="https://twitter.com/susam">Susam Pal</a> with the intention of
providing beginners to Emacs yet another way of learning Emacs. This
page consists of a sequence of Emacs keys and commands that are
carefully sequenced so that beginners to Emacs can find the most
essential keys and commands very early on this page.
</p>
<!--
<p>
Emacs experts can also find interesting keys and commands on this page.
Just skip the first 20 entries or so and scroll down to the 21st entry
and begin reading there. You might find some interesting keys and
commands there that you either did not know about or that you knew but
you forget to use them actively.
</p>
-->
<p>
There is a demo in the form of screencast for each entry on this page.
The length of each screencast does not exceed 10 seconds, so you can
pick any entry on this page and you should be able to learn something
useful about Emacs in less than a minute.
</p>
<p>
This website documents only the keys and commands available in vanilla
GNU Emacs. Emacs distributions like Spacemacs, Doom Emacs, etc. are not
covered here.

<h2 id="faq">Frequenty Asked Questions (FAQ)<a href="#faq"></a></h2>
<ol class="faq">
  <li id="faq-install">
    <h3>
      How can I install Emacs?
      <a href="#faq-install"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      Visit <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">GNU Emacs
      Download &amp; Installation</a> for more details.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-init">
    <h3>
      How can I make my Emacs look like the one in the screencasts?
      <a href="#faq-init"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      See this <a
      href="https://github.com/susam/emacskeys/blob/master/bin/init.el">init.el</a>
      that is used to customize Emacs to get the user interface you see
      in the screencasts. First copy the content of this file. Then
      start Emacs and type <code>C-x C-f ~/.emacs.d/init.el RET</code>.
      Then type <code>C-y</code> to paste. Then type <code>C-x
      C-s</code> to save. Finally type <code>C-x C-c</code> to quit.
      Start Emacs again and the user interface should look similar to
      the ones in the screencasts.
    </p>

  <li id="faq-no-audio">
    <h3>
      Why can I not hear anything in the screencasts?
      <a href="#faq-no-audio"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      There is no audio in the screencasts. All screencasts are silent
      videos.
    </p>
  </li>
  <li id="faq-recording">
    <h3>
      What tools do you use to make the screencasts?
      <a href="#faq-recording"></a>
    </h3>
    <p>
      I use FFmpeg, the Swiss Army Knife for audio/video manipulation. I
      run a recent version of GNU Emacs with a tiny initialization file
      that makes Emacs look minimal and loads a dark color theme for it.
      FFmpeg is used to create a video capture of the screen while I
      demo the Emacs operations. The key sequence overlay that appears
      in green at the bottom of each video are subtitles added using
      FFmpeg. See the initialization file
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacskeys/blob/master/bin/init.el">init.el</a>,
      and the scripts
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacskeys/blob/master/bin/record">record</a>
      and
      <a href="https://github.com/susam/emacskeys/blob/master/bin/encode">encode</a>
      for more details.
